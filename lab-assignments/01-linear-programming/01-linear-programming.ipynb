    "In this lab, you will explore a useful extension of linear programming duality (covered in class\n",
    "LP Day 1) called linear programming sensitivity analysis. Here, we aim to find:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does the solution change when the objective function changes?\n",
    "- How does the solution change when the resource limits change?\n",
    "- How does the solution change when a constraint is added to the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to these types of questions is solving lots of slightly different linear programming problems. This method would work, but it is inelegant and (for large problems) computationally expensive (but in most cases today, computation is cheap and computing solutions to many problems is a standard technique to study sensitivity in practice). However, there is a more elegant solution\n",
    "that gives these answers just by examining the dual information provided by the Simplex Algorithm.\n",

    "**Consider the following scenario:** An instrument company makes trombones and trumpets. A trombone requires 40 square inches of metal sheet and a trumpet requires 30 square inches of metal. Metal costs $1 per square inch and 40,000 square inches are available. It takes two hours of skilled labor to make a novice quality trombone or a novice quality trumpet. Three more hours of skilled labor will turn a novice quality trombone into a professional trombone. Two more hours of skilled labor will turn a novice quality trumpet into a professional trumpet. There are 6000 hours of skilled labor available. Assume that you do not need to pay for labor. Assume that you can sell fractional trombones and trumpets. The market selling prices and production costs are given in the following table:\n",

    "1. The shadow price is the rate of change in the objective function (profit, in this case) when the right-hand side (RHS) of a constraint is increased by one unit, while keeping all other factors constant. In the context of the metal sheet constraint, the shadow price tells us how much the profit would increase if the available metal were increased by one additional unit of metal (1 square inch).\n",
    "If the shadow price is positive, it means that the metal constraint is binding, and adding more metal will lead to an increase in profit because we can produce more products. If the shadow price is zero, it indicates that the metal constraint is not binding, i.e., there is unused metal capacity, and increasing the metal supply would not change the optimal production plan or profit.\n",
    "2. Using the shadow price of 2.67, the profit increase when the metal quantity increased by 500 square units is $1333.33.\n",
    "3. Solving the problem again with the increased metal supply, the new profit is $108000 which is $1333.33 more the $106666 when the metal quantity was 40000 square inches. This verifies the expected profit change calculated using the shadow price. "

Since novice instruments have lower profit margins than professional instruments, this shift will result in a decrease in total profit. The change makes it less attractive to produce professional instruments due to the higher labor cost, ultimately lowering the overall profitability of the production plan."
